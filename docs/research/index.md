# Overview

Technology in Stellaris is divided into 3 research areas with each area corresponding with one of the research resources:

- Engineering research.png Engineering
- Physics research.png Physics
- Society research.png Society
 
Additionally, each of the ~400 techs belongs to one of 13 subcategories divided between the areas (most appearing pre-dominantly in one area though not exclusively).

The user interaction aspect utilizes a card shuffle approach rather than a traditional tech tree presentation, thereby introducing an element of semi-randomness into the system.

Each technology has a base cost which is modified by "Technology and Tradition Cost" (from galaxy settings set when starting a new game) and by Empire sprawl.png empire size (the research cost is increased by 0.2% for each point of empire size above 100).
